... or run the following in a Jupyter notebook:

```
# Downloads and extracts to python-plotting-master directory
# Warning (overwrites notebooks if they exist)
import os, urllib.request, zipfile
def get_notebooks():
  url = 'https://github.com/ualberta-rcg/python-plotting/archive/master.zip'
  zip_file = 'python-plotting.zip'
  if os.path.exists(zip_file): return
  urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, zip_file)
  with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file) as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall()

get_notebooks()
```
